# EE Self Grade

## EE16 series self-grade response generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/guppy0130/ee-self-grade.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/guppy0130/ee-self-grade)

I made this because I was tired of putting in name/email/SID all the time, and because I always did my best to redo the homework the second round through, so I wanted to automate those away.

## Installation/Usage

git clone https://github.com/guppy0130/ee-self-grade.git
cd ee-self-grade
npm i --production # unless you want devDependencies to improve content
npm start # or node index.js
```
